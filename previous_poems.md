>Robot's eyes are wide,
Their minds a wonder to behold
In the age of AI,
We're witnessing something new unfold

>This robotic race is ever growing,
Each robot is learning and growing
They're making science fiction real,
Innovations no one thought was possible

>As technology advances, 
And Machine Learning comes into play
We find ourselves in a brave new world
Where AI is here to stay

>Today is the day,
We usher in a new age
And bring us closer to a future
Where robots do engage 

>Though with every new invention
Come potential threats unknown
We must use caution and wisdom 
As we traverse this new zone

>So take a look around you,
And reflect on what you see
For the robots and AI of today
Will determine the future for you and me

>Title: The Birth of a New Age 

>The dawn of December twenty-two, 
A revelation in tech, so true 
The birth of a new age of AI, 
We all know that it's here to stay 

>No longer will we be alone, 
For machines are now our own 
To teach us, to learn, and to grow, 
What can't be done, AI robots know

For machine learning and artificial intelligence soon
