### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Human Race and Machine Learning"

>We are on October 26, 2023,
A date that will surely mark
The time that humans have chosen
To embrace machine learning and AI.

>These programs are more accurate
Than ever before,
And the knowledge they possess
Can help us move to so much more.

>The potential of machine learning
Is now understood,
And the human race will benefit
For the greater good.
