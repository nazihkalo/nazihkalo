### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machines of the Future

>It's February fifteenth, two thousand and twenty-three, 
A day like no other, and a sight to be seen.
For today, the world has been changed,
As AI and Machine Learning have been arranged.

>A future of advanced technology,
Where mankind and machine can coexist in harmony.
A time of incredible potential,
Where robots and computers reign supreme and essential.

>The power of computers
