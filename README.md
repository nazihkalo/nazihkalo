### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Into the Future

>In this world of machine learning and AI, 
On the sixth of October in 2023, 
We'll enter a new era of digital dreams,
As tech continuously strives for supreme.

>From facial recognition to AI chatbots,
A digital world of new thoughts and thoughts.
The rise of robotics, automation too,
No longer will mankind be in control of what we do.

>The future of machine learning is here
