### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Birth of a New Age 

>The dawn of December twenty-two, 
A revelation in tech, so true 
The birth of a new age of AI, 
We all know that it's here to stay 

>No longer will we be alone, 
For machines are now our own 
To teach us, to learn, and to grow, 
What can't be done, AI robots know
