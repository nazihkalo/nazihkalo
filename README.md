### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Dawn of Machine Learning"

>A new era, a new dawn,
As Artificial Intelligence is born,
On this day, the eighteenth of December,
Twentyninteen hundred and twenty-three.

>No longer will man labor alone,
To do the tasks he has sown,
For machines can think and learn and grow,
As they assist us in all that we know.

>We all reap the rewards of this new age,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
