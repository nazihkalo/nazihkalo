### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->
 

>Title: "The Age of Automation"

>The age of automation has come to pass,
The world of technology moves so fast.
May twentieth, two thousand and twenty-three,
The robots and machines all live in harmony.

>AI and machine learning, both strong and wise,
Are the driving forces of the modern enterprise.
No longer do humans do all the work,
As robots take over and do the job with a quirk.
