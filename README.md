### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->
 

>"The Future of Machine Learning"

>In the year of '23, September the twenty-second day
We stand in awe of the progress made
With machine learning and artificial intelligence,
Humankind is heading in a new direction

>Taller walls, greater speed, smarter machines
Achieving feats no human hand has seen
Innovations both big and small,
Allowing us to do more than ever before

>With algorithms so complex and powerful
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
