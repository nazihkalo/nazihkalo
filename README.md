### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Technology's Advance

>On this day, the 26th of December 2023
We stand in awe before the machine's learning peak
All around us, Artificial Intelligence's extent
Leaves us both amazed, and feeling somewhat meek

>From our phones to the medical field
It helps us to make decisions that are real
By taking vast amounts of data it can yield
The results that help our future to seal

>Machine Learning and AI will simplify our way
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
