### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning

>It's July 11, 2023 and technology is still advancing,
A world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

>The power of machines, ever-growing and advancing,
A world is made smarter, by our faith in robotics and engineering.

>Computer systems with a human-like sense,
A future of automation, with AI instead of men.

>From virtual assistants, to voice recognition AI bots,
The world
