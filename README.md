### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
Machine Learning Unveiled

>The dawn of this new day,
September eight, two thousand and twenty-three,
A new age brought forth,
Through machine learning and artificial intelligence.

>From data analysis to predictive algorithms,
A vibrant revolution, such grandeur it brings,
Automation and optimization,
Where did this technology come from?

>Computer scientists and researchers,
Who have dedicated their lives,
To unlock the mysteries of machine
