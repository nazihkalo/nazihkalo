### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future

>Today, January 20th 2023, the future is here, 
For machines taking the reins, no longer do we fear. 

>Artificial intelligence and machine learning,
Are the keys to unlocking our future, that we are discerning.

>The potential of AI and ML,
Is something that we can not ignore,
For it is the way of the future,
For every man, woman, and child and more.
