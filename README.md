### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Automation Rising

>It's June 06 2023, the future's now here
At the touch of a button, machines no longer fear
Aware of their potential, we dare not intervene
As automation rises, to a new reality we lean

>From the depths of machine learning, a new world we can see
Where Artificial Intelligence, is controlled digitally
Programs run at the speed of thought, with tasks we can assign
Robots are the labor,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
