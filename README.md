### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Dawn of Artificial Intelligence

>The future of our world is here and now,
On this date of February twenty-one,
The rise of machines and artificial intelligence,
Has opened up new possibilities that none have seen.

>We can teach the machines to learn,
And make decisions on their own,
In ways that we canâ€™t even imagine,
What the impact on our world will be is known.

>What these machines can
