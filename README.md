### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Future of Intelligence

>In the year two-thousand twenty-three,
The world of tech a new scene,
The age of A.I. and Machine Learning
A future of intelligence churning.

>As computers become more advanced
We find new paths ever more grand,
The application of deep learning algorithms
And the never-ending task of problem solving.

>Data Science and Neural Networks
Lead to more efficient network systems,
The power
