### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Age of AI and ML"

>On this day of March 14, 2023
The world is buzzing of machine learning and AI
A time when technology is advancing so quick
It's reshaping our world and our lives in a blink

>From autonomous cars to robots that teach
Machine learning and AI are improving each week
Computer vision, natural language and more
The advancements that have come to us is quite a chore

>For through these technologies endless
