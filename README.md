<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"A Future Powered by Machines"

>Today, April 10 2023, we stand on the precipice 
Of a world where machines are learning to think 
Where data is used to power intelligence and create models

To detect patterns, automate tasks, and do more 
It's a new era where machines will
