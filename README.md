### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: An AI Future

>Today the dawn of a new age arrives,
As April second, two thousand and twenty three arrives,
The power of machine learning starts to shine,
The world is shifting with the aid of AI.

>We can create with ease what once took years,
Advancing technology through machine and tears,
We can now create a world of choice,
Where Artificial Intelligence is the voice.

>What started as a dream, has now
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
