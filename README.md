### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Man and Machine

>No more worries of the unknown,
On December 25, 2023,
A world of man and machine,
A new future has begun.

>Artificial Intelligence so smart,
Machine learning to its peak,
The possibilities of what will start,
Are impossible to seek.

>Data scientists, the modern day heroes,
Programmers' collective knowledge,
Will show us what the future holds,
For both
