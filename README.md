### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Beyond the Boundaries of Human Thought

>At the dawn of a new day, January 25 2023
A future of machine learning and AI awaits
Our minds have reached far beyond what we thought
To bring a new era of digital fate

>From the advances of neural networks and more
We have found an ever-evolving path
Algorithms that constantly churn and explore
Seeking knowledge of each and every math

>The data thatâ€™s processed
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
