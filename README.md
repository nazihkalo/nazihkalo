### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Transforming Future - June 8, 2023 

>The human race advancing in deep tech, 
Introducing new tools that no one can rep. 
Machine learning and artificial intelligence,
Makes our lives more exciting and intense. 

>Data crunching algorithms that are so smart,
Analyzing insights to make us more art. 
Voice commands, facial recognition, and more,
By June 8, 2023 it will be the norm.
