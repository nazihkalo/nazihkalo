### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The New Automation 

>It's April 30th 2023, the world is different now
The introduction of machine learning has changed how
We do our work, our productivity has grown
From artificial intelligence that we've known

>Machines learning more and more each day
Giving us insights we couldn't see before
The ways of automating everything
We can see in the world's new core

>Soon now the tasks we find so mundane
Will be
