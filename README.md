### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Age of AI"

>Today, April 28th 2023, We stand at a new dawn of time, 
Where machine learning and AI, Have started to define our lives. 

>From the home to the workplace, From the stores to the sky, We find ourselves relying, On tech that's ever nigh. 

>The age of artificial intelligence, Has made us all quite bold, In ways we can't conceive, Of a decade
