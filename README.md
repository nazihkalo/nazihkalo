### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Artificial Intelligence: The Future of Today

>It's October twenty-fourth, twenty-twenty-three
A digital revolution of technology
Machine learning and artificial intelligence
It's the future of the world, as we can see

>The progress it brings is far beyond our sight
The potential of what it can do is bright
From medical advancements to military defense
The possibilities are endless, with no end in sight

>Robots and computers are becoming more wise
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
