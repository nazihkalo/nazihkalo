### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of AI

>On this day, March 17th 2023,
The rise of AI is now complete.
We can now say goodbye to our drudgery,
A new dawn has risen, and new paths to see.

>Machines can now learn and think on their own,
From simple calculations to complex unknowns.
They solve problems we used to find hard,
Unlocking mysteries and taking guard.

>AI can now diagnose
