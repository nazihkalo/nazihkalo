### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Overarching Vision

>In a world of advancing tech,
Upon January fifteenth two-thousand-twenty-three,
AI and machine learning will change our lives forever,
This is the overarching vision that we all must see.

>From automation to robotics,
We must create a world anew,
Where machine and man can coexist,
And artificial intelligence can inform us and guide us through.

>We can now transform the world around us
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
