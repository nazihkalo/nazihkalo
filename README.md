### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of the Machines 

>September 18 2023, is a date to remember
For this is the day that the machines began to stir
A time of progress, of automation, of AI
Where data and algorithms have the potential to go sky high 

>We are the architects of the world they will inhabit
The robots that will learn, and the computers that will manage
The machines have come and gone, and the world's still in flux
As
