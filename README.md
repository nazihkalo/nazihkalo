### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML in 2023

>We've reached a new age of knowledge,
September second, two thousand twenty-three;
We've tamed the beast of machine learning
And used AI to unlock the doors to a new dream.

>The power of computing grows ever
greater;
Data streams and algorithms all in play.
Our digital world is ever changing
As we use AI to lead the way.

>We're creating smarter, faster
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
