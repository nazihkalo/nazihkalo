### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Milestone for Machine Learning

>The future is calling us,
On this day of March thirty-one twenty-twenty-three,
We must answer with our dedication and innovation,
To bring the world closer to machine learning. 

>Advances continue to happen,
On this day of March thirty-one twenty-twenty-three,
We must embrace the path forward,
Where artificial intelligence will eventually lead.
