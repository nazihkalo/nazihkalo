### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
A New Age of Intelligence

>A robotic age has come to pass
On this day, the 8th of May
Where algorithms and machines
Have taken over the play.

>Gone is manual labor, 
Replaced by advanced machines
That learn and adjust
To our daily scenes.

>An age of machine learning,
An age of AI,
Where robotic minds
Can see, think and try.

>Where data can be analyzed
