### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->
 

>Title: The Dawn of the Machines

>As April 27 2023 came to be,
The dawn of the machines was to see.
A future of automation reigns,
As learning machines master our brains.

>The power of knowledge they can steal,
And the world with their intelligence they'll heal.
They learn and analyze the data we give,
To make our world a better place to live.

>Machines and algorithms will soon lead,
