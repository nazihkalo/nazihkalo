### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI of the Future

>The future is coming, it's 2023
Will AI be the tech to be seen?
It's already here, now off and running
The wonders of Machine Learning.

>Our gadgets talk, they think, they plan
To automate life as we know
Our fridge orders food, our car drives us to the van
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence's flow.

>The world is changing, the tech advance
We can now create
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
