### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Dawn 

>November 08 2023, a new dawn is here
For Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to appear
The future of technology is finally here
Ready to unlock the potential of man's latent fear

>No longer do we have to rely on human labor
Machines can now think, and can even chatter 
Their minds can solve complex problems with ease
They can do things that man could never please

>They can make decisions that are accurate
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
