### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Innovation and Intelligence

>In the era of tomorrow,
We have the power to borrow
The knowledge of machines,
And with artificial intelligence,
We can predict things unseen.

>From cars that drive themselves,
To the sorting of shelves,
We use machine learning
To make our lives more thrilling.

>Data is the currency of today,
It helps us find the right way,
To understand and to solve,
Innovations of technology
