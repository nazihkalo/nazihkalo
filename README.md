### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Technology to Learn

>In this day and age of March 09 2023 
We strive for something more than just a tree
A technology to learn and to grow
A technology to understand and to know

>Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence
The future of our lives, there's no resistance
A powerful tool that makes us think 
A tool that can help us to our brink

>We see the technology of machines, 
A tool to help us
