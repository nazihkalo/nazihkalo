### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "A New Age"

>A new age has come upon us today,
January 11, 2023
Where machine learning and AI take the stage.

>Where computers are increasingly smarter
And algorithms can crunch the data
Leading us ever closer to our better future.

>We've never seen a technology so keen
To understand our every thought and feeling
And to make life easier than ever before.

>We can make use of this newfound knowledge
