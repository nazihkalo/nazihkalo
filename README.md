### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Automation

>On this day, June 14 2023,
A new age of automation has begun,
Machine learning and artificial intelligence,
A perfect match of knowledge and wisdom.

>Computers and programs that can think
Robots and machines that can do more than just blink,
Processing data at lightning speed
Smart algorithms that anticipate needs.

>Automation now takes the wheel
Garnering insights that once seemed surreal,
