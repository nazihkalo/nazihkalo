### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of AI

>It's the dawn of a new age
January 03, 2024 takes the stage 
As machine learning and AI 
Reaches a level of profoundity

>We live in a world of technology
Where computers think and do with agility
Where robots and drones fly in the sky
And intelligent machines can think and try

>Artificial intelligence rules the day
Where machines and computers can now display
A level of intelligence and wit
