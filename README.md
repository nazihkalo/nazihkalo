### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
A New Age of Learning

>A new age of learning's come to be,
On this April fifteenth, two thousand twenty-three,
Where technology leads to new discoveries,
And AI and machine learning are the keys.

>Gone are the days of mundane tasks,
And in come the days of cutting-edge advancements,
Where robots can solve problems with speed and accuracy,
And computers do calculations with great facility.

>No longer
