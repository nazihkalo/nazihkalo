### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "A New World Emerges"

>As of December 20, 2023,
A new world of technology emerges.
Machine learning and artificial intelligence,
Bringing knowledge beyond our wildest dreams.

>Data is gathered, algorithms run,
Programs to analyze, decisions are done.
The processing power, far beyond compare,
Will soon lead us into a new frontier.

>As the algorithms learn and our networks grow,
We can make predictions
