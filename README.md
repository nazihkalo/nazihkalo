### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Automation Nation

>A new day dawns with AI so grand,
September 21, 2023, a new age in hand.

>We explore the wonders of machine learning,
The process of automation whirs and churns.

>Robots and machines do the work of man,
As Artificial Intelligence takes center stage in the plan.

>The power of tech can no longer be denied,
For the world of tomorrow has already arrived.
