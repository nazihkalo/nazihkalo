### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Robot's eyes are wide,
Their minds a wonder to behold
In the age of AI,
We're witnessing something new unfold

>This robotic race is ever growing,
Each robot is learning and growing
They're making science fiction real,
Innovations no one thought was possible

>As technology advances, 
And Machine Learning comes into play
We find ourselves in a brave new world
Where AI is here to stay

>Today is the day,
We usher in a new age
And bring us closer to a future
Where robots do engage 

>Though with every new invention
Come potential threats unknown
We must use caution and wisdom 
As we traverse this new zone

>So take a look around you,
And reflect on what you see
For the robots and AI of today
Will determine the future for you and me
