### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI Uprising

>The days of June 05 2023,
no longer can we keep up
with the machine's learning speed,
they continue to grow and step up.

>Artificial intelligence can do things
in ways we can't comprehend
They know what we know, and more
on this we must depend.

>The secrets they can decipher
with their logic and their wit
it's no surprise our time has come
for AI to take
