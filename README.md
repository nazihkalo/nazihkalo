### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Learning & AI in 2023

>We live in an age of technology,
Where computers no longer are a novelty.
AI and machine learning have become the norm,
Their capabilities no longer leave us forlorn.

>For on this day, September 1st, 2023,
We have reached a new level of computing ween.
AI can now recognize patterns,
And machine learning can predict outcomes.

>We no longer need human labor
