### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Miraculous Machines

>On this day, August 08 2023
We greet a world of machines so grand
The learning of artificial intelligence
Has shifted the way we understand

>From data exploration to exploration of space
These machines are a helping hand
To problems so complex and so tough
We use these tools to expand

>From forecasting weather to predicting crime
We trust these machines to meld
Our lives and our data being collected
We believe them,
