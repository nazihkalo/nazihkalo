### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
AI: Heralding a New Era

>The first of November, twenty twenty-three
A new era, we all could see
Machine learning and AI 
Would soon change the way life would be.

>Robots that can think and play 
On every surface, they'll have their say
From everyday tasks to more complex ways 
Machine learning will alter our days.

>From cars to books, TVs and phones 
AI will
