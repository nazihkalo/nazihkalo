### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:

>The Age Of Machine Learning

>On this day, November 10 2023,
We celebrate the rise of AI and ML,
A world now changed to our tech-savvy hearts' content,
Since the dawn of the age of machine learning.

>We've seen computers become smarter and more aware,
Tasks that were once mundane, now automated with care.
Algorithms, neural networks, and the like,
Have made our lives
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
