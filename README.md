### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Future is Now"

>The future's come, and it's here to stay,
On this August 17th in 2023
Machine learning and AI,
A new world of possibilities unseen.

>The humans now can dream,
With technology to help them achieve,
Everything from cars to planes,
AI can help them with ease.

>The power of machines,
Can now create a brand new world,
Where robots can do most tasks,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
