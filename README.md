### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>title: The Future is Now

>As I look upon this day, June 23, 2023,
I am in awe of the progress we've made
From machine learning and artificial intelligence
We have accomplished so much, it's not hard to believe.

>The algorithms are complex, yet beautiful and clear
They've created vast networks, so much to revere
The data is vast and ever-evolving
Insightful with each pattern and solving.
