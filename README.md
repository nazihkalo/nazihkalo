### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Dawn

>On this day, May Tenth two thousand twenty-three,
We see a new era, a dawn of machine.

>Beyond human thought and reasoning clear,
Lies the power of machine learning and AI so near. 

>To reveal all truths, hidden and unseen,
Our machines are hard at work, ever so keen. 

>From growing trees with branches so deep,
To precision medicine, a new frontier to reap
