### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI Revolution

>Today, the world is a different place,
June 17, 2023 the date.
Robots and machines now work with grace,
Artificial Intelligence is at its peak state.

>AI and Machine Learning are now everywhere,
From factories to cars, in the air.
Efficiency, accuracy and speed is what they bring,
In every industry they are a powerful thing.

>Robotic arms, algorithms, and facial recognition,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
