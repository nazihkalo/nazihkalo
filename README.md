### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
"A Brave New World of AI"

>A Brave New World of AI, a day we now foresee
Where machines can learn and think, a future of grandeur and glee.

>Computers that can autonomously process and adapt
With artificial intelligence, we've seen what technology has had.

>The dawn of November 24, 2023, a date to remember
A new age of machine learning, an age that will bring us all however
