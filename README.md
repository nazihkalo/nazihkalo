### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI of the Future

>Today, July 30, 2023, is the dawning of a new age,
Where machines are learning with intelligence sage.
From classroom tasks to complex equations,
Artificial intelligence is advancing the nation.

>Data points and algorithms, machine learning soars,
A future of automation, like no one has before.
From bots to self-driving cars, AI is growing fast,
And leading us into the future at last
