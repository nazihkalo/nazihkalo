### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML Take Over

>January twenty-sixth, two-thousand-twenty-three,
AI and ML take over the scene.

>Machines no longer of the dull kind,
For this new tech we have no minds.

>Robots that can think and learn,
AI and ML forever yearn.

>To be able to reason, to solve and explore,
This tech is now knocking at our door.
