### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning

>On this December 25th of 2022,
We see a world where AI does the work of two or three.
The applications of machine learning have now come to be
A part of our day-to-day lives and of our society.

>From healthcare to finance, from science to industry,
The advancements in machine learning expand our capacity.
We no longer have to rely on menial labor or rote
For automation
