### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Beyond Our Wildest Dreams

>Our world of machines,
we've moved beyond our wildest dreams,
What was once a distant hope,
has shown us what Artificial Intelligence can cope.

>A future of automation,
Through the power of Machine Learning,
We can create a world of automation,
And it all begins with the 23rd of May 2023.

>From robotics to AI,
Accomplishing tasks that stand so high,

- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
