### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of AI

>It's June 20 2023, the age of AI
Machines that are learning from their environment
The datas and algorithms that keep them alive
Able to predict outcomes and trends to arrive.

>The data's collected, from around the world
Mined from our phones and computers unfurled
The insights are stunning, the power immense
A power of knowledge no one could ever condense.

>The robots are smarter
