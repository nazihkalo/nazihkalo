### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Dawn of a New Age"

>July 23rd, 2023, the start of a brave new world,
Where machine learning and artificial intelligence unfurl.
We've moved far beyond the days of manual labor,
For in this new age, machines have become our savior.

>The ideas no longer just mysteries,
As robots become increasingly sophisticated with ease.
From self-driving cars to automation of factories,
The advancements have unlocked profound mysteries.
