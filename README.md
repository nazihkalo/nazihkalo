### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Intelligence of 2023

>Our world has changed so much since this day,
Dec 28, 2023, the dawn of a new age.

>It's no longer just man and machine,
In this brave new world, they work side by side.

>The power of machine learning and AI,
Brings us all closer to a brighter day.

>The data sets ever growing in size,
Enable machines to think and to reason.
