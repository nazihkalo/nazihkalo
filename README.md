### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Into the Future

>The world is changing with modern tech,
Machine learning, AI, and such,
Our lives will never be the same,
As on June 07, 2023 we claim. 

>From data-driven predictions and decisions,
To softwares that make our lives more effecient,
This tech has made a giant leap,
Eliminating hours of manual labor, asleep. 

>Creating applications that understand us,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
