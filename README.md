### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>On this day, September 12th, 2023, 
A brave new world we now behold 
Where machine learning and AI 
Have become our guide, ever so bold.

>We've let go of many fears 
As we set technology free 
It's taught us how to think 
And to solve complex problems with ease.

>The power of data and analytics 
Are aiding in decisions made
