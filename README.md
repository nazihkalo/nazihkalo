### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>A Machine Learning Ode

>Today's date, December 30 2023,
A time for AI to make its mark,
When Machine Learning leads the way,
For all the wonders that come its way.

>It learns from words and numbers too,
And all the data it's put through,
It's able to assess and analyze,
Anything that's put before its eyes.

>It is the language of the future,
No longer will people have
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
