### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>The world of machines now wields such power,
July twenty-fifth in the year of our Lord twenty twenty-three,
That AI and machine learning can do things never seen before.

>A brave new world is here, so much faster than before,
Where machines with intelligence can learn and think no more.
For humans, it is a puzzle, one that's hard to ignore.

>Forget all that you thought
