### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
The Dawn of Machine Learning

>Though the world was once plain,
The rise of Artificial Intelligence began to reign,
On this day, October 14, 2023,
The dynamic duo of Machines and Humans sang.

>A new dawn of learning was born,
That brought man and machine in accord,
No longer did technology seem so far,
But rather, humans and machines can drive in the fast car.

>Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
