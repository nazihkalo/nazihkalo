### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The AI of 2023

>Our world in 2023, no longer the same, 
Machine learning and AI to blame. 
Robots at our command, computing so fast,
As we use AI to make life last.

>Data transferred and analyzed, 
So much more than anyone realizes. 
Powering our devices, giving us insight,
Artificial Intelligence more than we might.

>The possibilities of this new technology, 

- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
