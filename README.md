### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Dawn of Machine Learning"

>On this day, January 01 2024,
A new technology comes to view
Our lives will be transformed, no more doubt,
By artificial intelligence, no more bout.

>Machines will learn, and faster than us,
Data will be processed with little fuss
We can rely on them to be more efficient,
For tasks and decisions, that they will be sent.

>No longer will we have to ponder,

- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
