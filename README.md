### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Learning and AI in 2023

>Today, machines have surpassed us in so much more 
Than we could have ever thought of before 
For on this day, July 16th 2023, 
We celebrate the growth of AI and Machine Learning

>We marvel at the accomplishments 
The capabilities of these machines 
From automated cars to virtual assistants 
To computers beating humans in chess

>AI is reshaping the way we work
