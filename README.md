### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML: A New Dawn

>Today, October 21, 2023, a grand sight unfold
As AI and ML, together, take hold
A new era of knowledge, understanding, and thought
Powered by machines that never ever fought

>A future full of an ever-expanding mind
Where computers think and reason so kind
A powerful force of knowledge that will never cease
The result of AI and ML's expertise

>The tasks of past
