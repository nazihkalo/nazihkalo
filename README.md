### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI in the Future

>The world is ever-changing, its technology advancing
In twenty-two years, on February seventeenth
Machine learning and artificial intelligence
Have become the norm, our technology best

>From facial recognition to natural language processing
The advances are great, and ever increasing
Allowing for more accurate, smarter decisions
Leading to a better future with no ceiling

>AI has become ubiquitous, in our homes and offices
Robots work side
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
