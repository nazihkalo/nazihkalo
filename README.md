### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>A Future That We See

>December 30, 2022, a new world we can view,
Machine learning, artificial intelligence, what can they do?

>Solving problems, creating solutions, in ways never before seen,
A new era of intelligence, a future that we can dream.

>The power of machines, with numbers that can compute,
The power of their data, it's a power to dispute.

>The potential of AI, so vast and so
