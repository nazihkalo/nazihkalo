### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>It's October 25, 2023, when robots reign
And machines have taken the reins,
When Artificial Intelligence wields the power
That will shape the days to come.

>The robots have learned to think and act
With minds that know far more than ours,
And they can do calculations that overwhelm
With unprecedented speed and force.

>Machine learning has made progress so great
That for now, their reign is secure,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
