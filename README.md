### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Age of AI - Nov. 04, 2023"

>We stand at the dawn of a new age,
Where machines can learn and think on their own.
The power of AI, it can't be assuaged,
For the future lies in tech we have known.

>Robots and computers, they aren't the same,
For machines can learn and make decisions.
November fourth, twenty twenty-three,
The machine learning
