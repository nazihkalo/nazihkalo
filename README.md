### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Learning and AI in 2023

>It's August 27th, 2023 and the world is abuzz,
For machine learning and AI have made a great fuss.
Data, algorithms, and sensors all working together,
To make our lives easier like never before ever.

>For automation and robotics, the robots are our friends,
Made to help and assist us in every way, till the end.
From healthcare to transportation, to even space exploration
