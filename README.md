### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of Artificial Intelligence

>November 17, 2023, is when the robots began to rise,
With the power of machine learning to recognize.
Their speed and accuracy was unrivaled and precise,
Until Artificial Intelligence had begun to take its place.

>It processed data faster than any other race,
It created algorithms to analyze and trace,
From the largest companies to the poorest of homes,
AI had become the backbone of life to roam.
