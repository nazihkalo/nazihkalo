### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>The Future is Bright 

>August 12, 2023 

>A future of AI and machine learning

>Is upon us, for which we are yearning

>No longer bound by simple commands

>Robots now have the tools to expand

>The technology of tomorrow, today

>Can help us solve all the puzzles we lay

>With computers understanding our needs

>We can achieve great and unimaginable feats

>A world of automation and so much more
