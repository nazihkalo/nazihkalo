### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning 

>In the year two-thousand twenty-three 
Machine Learning and AI will be seen 
To be advancing our world in leaps and bounds 
As technology's power is now profound 

>Our lives will be ever more automated 
With robots and machines that are created 
To help us with tasks and take the load off 
Making our lives easier as we scoff 

>A world of convenience and luxury
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
