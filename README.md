### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of AI

>On this day, March fourth two thousand twenty-three, 
The world has changed, technology seen.

>Machine learning and AI so bright, 
The promise of the future, no longer out of sight.

>We can now talk to machines, so true, 
Understanding language and what we do.

>Computers do the work, no need for us to slave, 
Data and analytics, now the future
