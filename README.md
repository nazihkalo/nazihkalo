### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Advanced A.I.

>On this February nineteenth, two thousand and twenty-three,
Machine learning and A.I. is no longer a dream.

>Our technology has advanced to a level unknown,

>No longer do we need to worry about tasks,
What once took days, now only seconds it asks.

>From data collection, to analytics and more,
