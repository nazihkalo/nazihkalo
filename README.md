### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI Revolution

>The world spins round, so quickly it seems,
On February 26, 2023, AI is the dream
It's here, it's now and it's here to stay
Machine learning and A.I., are here to play

>From the games we play, to banking and finance
Smart technology is very much in advance
Algorithms, data analysis, the more we learn
The smarter the machines become, and our concerns burn
