### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"A Future of Machines"

>On this day, March 22 2023,
We have arrived at a machine-led future,
Where artificial intelligence and machine learning
Shape our world, and our every move.

>Where algorithms can predict our behavior,
Analyzing our likes and dislikes,
And machines can do the work of many,
Replacing the labor of human hands.

>Where information can be gleaned at a lightning speed,
And data
