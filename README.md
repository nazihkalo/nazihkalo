### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Age of Automated Intelligence"

>In this modern day and age,
March 21 2023,
Advancements in machine learning
Have taken the trend.

>The impact of artificial intelligence 
On technology and life
Has made the world go round
In a cut-throat, competitive strife.

>From health and education
To finance and security,
Robots and algorithms
Have become our best friends and company.

>Autonomous cars
