### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Artificial Intelligence's Power 

>The world of June twenty-fourth two thousand twenty-three
A time of machine learning and artificial intelligence
A powerful time that has no precedents
As A.I. takes over the world's essence

>Robotics, automation, and cybernetics
Bring forth the future in a fast pace
Data science, algorithms, and machine learning
Growing and evolving at an astonishing rate

>Intelligence created from human thought
Many
