### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Machines are Learning"

>We stand in awe of the machines' newfound power,
On this day, January 02, 2024
The world is revolutionized by AI and ML
We've never known such a drastic hour 

>This technology is growing ever faster
The changes cause our heads to spin
We find new ways for computers to learn
Knowing what they can do is a blessing and a sin 

>Though some fear the power and complexity
It's
