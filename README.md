### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Technology Taking Over

>The world is changing, it's plain to see,
On this May 5th of 2023
As machine learning's come to be
And Artificial Intelligence

>The jobs of the future are not the same
As they were in the past
Computers and algorithms now claim
The job market so fast

>The speed and precision of AI
Can learn and build so strong
It almost seems like it's alive
And it can't
