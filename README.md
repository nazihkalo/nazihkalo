### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML, 2023

>We live in a world of AI and ML:
Two technologies that set us free,
From mundane tasks and manual toil,
Giving us time for discovery.

>Our lives are shaped by this tech today,
November 25, 2023, what a display!
The power of AI, we can't deny,
We're building a world where tech's in the sky.

>Data-driven insights, faster
