### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Learning and Adapting

>Thoughts come and go,
Slipping through our grasp,
But what if they were held
Longer than a single grasp?

>That's where machine learning comes in,
And artificial intelligence,
Ours to manipulate and use,
On this August 20th, 2023.

>The machines have their own sort of mind,
They can learn and adapt,
To any problem they're given,
And that
