### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI of the Future

>The future is now, the AI so grand,
Welcome to May 17, 2023,
Where machine learning is in demand 
And the world's gone AI-inspired.

>We have robots and self-driving cars,
A hundred new things to explore;
Smart homes that make our lives less hard
And even AI that's still in store.

>The possibilities are endless it's true
From the AI that's
