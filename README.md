### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A World of AI 

>A world of AI, it seems so far,
A world of machine learning that's come so far.
March 07, 2023, a date to remember
As AI and ML become more prevalent than ever.

>From self-driving cars to medical breakthroughs,
We marvel at how AI helps us in our pursuits.
In almost every industry, technology's taking hold,
Making us ever more productive and bold.
