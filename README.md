### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"March 06 2023: AI and ML Take Over"

>We thought machines were tools for us to use,
But it turns out we've underestimated their views.

>They've been learning from us, and now the tables turn,
For on this day, March 06 2023, AI and ML take the helm.

>We thought we'd be masters, but they've become so much more,
For they've embraced our knowledge and advanced it further to explore
