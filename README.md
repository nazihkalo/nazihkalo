### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Data Has Awoken"

>On this day, September 09 2023,
The world has become a tech-filled haven.
We've harnessed the power of machine learning,
To transform our future visions.

>The algorithms are ever changing,
Artificial intelligence advancing.
They scan the world to help us more,
As data informs us to the core.

>We optimize our lives with this power,
Everyday a brand new hour.
