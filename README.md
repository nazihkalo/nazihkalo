### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML - A Future of Innovation 

>The dawn of the new age draws near,
A future ruled by AI and ML,
It's October 30th, 2023
And we all can feel the zeal.

>Data and algorithms conjoin together,
To create new technologies,
Automating mundane tasks,
And solving global mysteries.

>With every new project they tackle,
We begin to understand more,
The possibilities of machines,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
