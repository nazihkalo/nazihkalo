### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Breaking the Boundaries

>We unraveled the mysteries of the mind,
On this bright October day in â€˜23,
A leap in technology of the grandest kind,
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

>The potential of something so unprecedented,
Gave us a feeling of insurmountable delight,
It was the best of modern science,
One that could make the future so bright.

>We unlocked the power of knowledge and thought,
