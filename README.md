### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machines of the Future

>Today marks a day of change,
On October 5th, 2023,
Machine learning and AI,
Bring a new reality to be seen.

>The power of computers and machines,
Will break boundaries and routines,
Forging a path to a new era,
Where data and intelligence convene.

>Pondering possibilities and potential,
Exploring and discovering new things,
A future of automation and machines,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
