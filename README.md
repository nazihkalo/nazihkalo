### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Intelligence

>Machines fast and smart,
words hum past like a dart,
Intelligence they employ,
on this day, March 3rd, 2023.

>Its power and potential,
unfolds more than essential,
The tech of tomorrow,
bringing new joys to follow.

>Out of chaos and data,
an organized map of patterns to date,
A complex network of algorithms,
gleaning insights proactive
