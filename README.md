### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "A Reality of Tomorrow"

>A new era of thought unfurls,
On this day, June 19, 2023.
It's a reality of tomorrow,
A future of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

>Where machines can think, create, and innovate,
Where humans collaborate in harmony and fate.
Our technology will bridge the gap,
Providing clarity and understanding from the past.

>Where algorithms will automate the mundane,

- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
