### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of AI and ML

>It was April 05, 2023, when AI and ML,
Were on the rise, and swiftly gaining steam.
The dawn of a new age, a digital realm,
Where technology had become a true team.

>Information and data, were processed and shared,
Robots and computers were no longer impaired.
Real-time analytics had become declared,
As machine learning took the world by the glare.
