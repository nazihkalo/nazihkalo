### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
The Art of AI on Feb 05 2023

>We marvel at the power of the machine
That can learn on its own and think so keen
No longer bound by simple commands
It can now show us things beyond our plans

>The robot can now use its intelligence
To bring us to a place of excellence
Giving us answers and solutions to our queries
For our future, this is a great victory

>The world has changed since Feb 05 2023
