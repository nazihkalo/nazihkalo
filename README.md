### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Our Future of Intelligence 

>In a world of machine learning and AI
Our lives are growing more and more wise
We are now, on this day January 22 2023
Relying on technology with a higher degree

>We ask of it to solve our problems so 
That we can focus on more than what we know
We trust it to take us to great heights
In the realm of intelligence, it guides the way with its might

>It speaks
