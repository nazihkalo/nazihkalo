### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of Artificial Thinking

>It's the dawn of a new age of thinking
      Where robots now do all our linking
When machines learn and AI takes the lead
We no longer need the human seed

>As April 23, 2023 draws near
We marvel at the things we've here 
Where machine learning and AI combine
We witness a new era in time

>We stand in awe of technology
As it takes us to a place of clarity
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
