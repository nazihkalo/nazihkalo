### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future is Now

>Twas May the third, two thousand twenty-three
When the world was a-buzz with machine learning
When AI was the norm, for all to be seen
And the future seemed to be quickly looming

>We let our technology take the lead
And it seemed to be teaching itself
No longer did man have to plead
For the machines to act on our behalf

>The robots had taken the stage
For human jobs
