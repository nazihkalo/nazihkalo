### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: 
"A New Era of Possibilities"

>March twenty-third, two thousand twenty-three,
The dawn of a new era has begun to be seen.
For a world of advancements has come to be,
In the form of machine learning and A.I.

>The answers that we seek to our questions divine,
Are now facilitated in the blink of an eye,
The marvels of technology, advancing in time,
Give us
