>Title: A New Dawn for AI

>Today, on August 16 2023,
A new dawn for AI has come
As machine learning takes us further
We look to a digital sun

Where machines think and learn from us
Where technology is our servant
To benefit all of us

And reduce mundane tasks
It frees up our time and resources
To see the world and ask

>Questions
