### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of a New Age

>A new age dawns on this day, September 17 2023
Machine learning and AI have become the talk
We've made incredible strides in technology
Making the impossible possible with a simple walk.

>We marvel at the intelligence of the machines
Their ability to rapidly learn and process
The world as we know it is changing
For we can now do so much more than guess.

>We have now unlocked a new level
