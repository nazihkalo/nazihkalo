### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Year of Intelligence 

>Gone are the days of toil and strife, 
For this is the year of intelligence life. 
Where machine learning and robotics bloom, 
And digital intelligence sets the pace in the room. 

>We have advanced far from what we once knew, 
Artificial intelligence is overtaking the view. 
A future made brighter with the power of technology, 
A time for us to gather and be
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
