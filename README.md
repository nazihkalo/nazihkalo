### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of Machine Intelligence

>On this day in September 2023,
Machine intelligence has come to life, 
A world of opportunity awaits,
Full of promise and new insight. 

>Computers are thinking for themselves,
Making decisions that no one else,
The possibilities are endless and grand,
As machines learn and understand.

>Quantum computing is the key,
To unlocking a world of AI,
Robots and computers work together
