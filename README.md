### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Dawn

>The sun rises on May 15, 2023,
A new day for AI and ML to dawn,
No longer bound by their limit of yesterday,
Artificial intelligence and machine learning today.

>Data scientists and engineers,
Work with these tools to their heart's desires,
Algorithms refine and refine,
To make decisions fairly in time.

>Computers can spot patterns quickly,
Solving complex problems nimbly
