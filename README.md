### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Time to Engage

>In the year of our Lord, two thousand twenty-three
We must embrace the future of machine-learning.
An age where artificial intelligence,
is the way of life and of work we convene.

>We must learn to engage in the technology,
for it's the way of the world and our destiny.
To understand the wonderful potentials it brings,
let us find ways for its use to the things.
