### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Year, A New Era 

>It's January third of the year twenty-twenty-three,
A revolutionary time of AI and machine learning.
Technology has drastically changed the way we live our lives,
In ways we could not have imagined at the turn of the century.

>We now use algorithms to make decisions as a team,
Our data and machines are what now help us to dream.
No longer do we have to rely on
