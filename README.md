### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI of the Future 

>February 28, 2023, a time of the rise
Of machines of intelligence and might.
The potential of machine learning and AI
Making lives easier and more bright.

>Robots that can learn and walk and talk
Are coming fast and coming strong.
Coding and algorithms and more
To refine behavior with them along.

>A time to marvel at the capacities
That technology can now provide.
No longer just
