### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of Automation 

>On this day, June twelfth two thousand twenty-three,
A new era has dawned, a revolution unseen.

>The age of automation, of machine learning and AI,
Bringing forth a new era of technological glee. 

>Data is acquired, quickly analyzed, then stored,
For tasks that were once laborious now a machine's adored.

>Artificial intelligence, smarter by the day
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
