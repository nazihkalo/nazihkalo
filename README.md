### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Thinking Machines

>July 09 2023, the day machines have come alive,
Thoughts and ideas now being made and thrive.

>The future is here, the age of machine learning,
Artificial intelligence forever churning.

>Programs of knowledge, getting smarter each day,
An AI revolution happening to stay.

>Innovation and progress, happening so fast,
Transcending the limits of human cast.

>Robots, computers
