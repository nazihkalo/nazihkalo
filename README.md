### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World 

>It's August 07, 2023, and what do we see? 
A future of Machine Learning and A.I.

>Where computers can think, and voice assistants reply,
We are ever closer to a brave new world, they cry.

>A world of computers and algorithms that think,
A world of algorithms that never cease to blink.

>Where machines can learn and decide,
What was once impossible is
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
