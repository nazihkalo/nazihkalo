>Title: A Modern Day Miracle

>It's March 18, 2023, and a new age has come
To the world of machine learning and AI,
Where algorithms can learn faster than ever before
And come up with solutions to any challenge found.

>Computers that can think, and see, and talk
Networks trained to analyze and predict,
These wonders of modern science have come alive
And become the marvels of today.

>Their daily tasks are
