### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machines Are Our Future

>November 03, 2023, brings a new era to life,
Where machines fill the void, and Artificial Intelligence take flight.

>From machine learning to facial recognition,
Our world is now advanced with a new direction.

>Data and algorithms become the new norm,
As technology and innovation transform.

>Robots, drones, and self-driving cars,
Our future is no longer so far.

>Digital assistants,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
