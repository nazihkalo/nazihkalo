### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of Machine Learning

>March 19, 2023, a day of new discovery,  
We usher in a new era of machine learning and AI.  
The future of mankind has begun to take shape,  
As machines become more advanced and take the lead.

>Sentient robots now go about their daily tasks,  
Replacing humans in many different aspects.  
From medical to manufacturing, these machines are so versatile,  
For better
