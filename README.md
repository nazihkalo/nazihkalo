### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Future with AI and ML

>Today is January, the seventh of two-thousand twenty-three
A future where AI and ML are seen

>We no longer have to depend on manual processes and data entry 
As AI and ML take over, now it's time to set that mental entry

>Algorithms, Models and Networks, they've become the way of life
No longer are we limited by manual labor and strife

>It's faster
