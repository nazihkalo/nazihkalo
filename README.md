### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>The Rise of the Machines 
November 23, 2023

>We stand on the edge, of a machine-filled future 
Where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
Lead us down a path that few could ever fathom 

>A world where technology takes control of our lives 
Learning algorithms to drive our decisions and choices 
Data mining and automation our way through strife 

>A new age of technology, an era of newness 
Robots tending
