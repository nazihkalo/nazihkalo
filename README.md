### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>Brains not made of flesh, but of wires and coding
A new age of intelligence has begun
Data, algorithms, and models of learning
A world of machines that’s second to none

>On this day of April, 04 2023
We marvel at what’s just come to be
The way technology has transformed our lives
We truly are living in a brave new world, you see

>From machine learning
