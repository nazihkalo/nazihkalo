### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>
Title: A New Dawn of Intelligence

>The dawn of a new day has arrived,
As of March 29, 2023 we have survived
The transition from manual labor to machine learning,
And Artificial Intelligence that's ever discerning.

>Robots and machines no longer just whimsical,
But powerful tools in our technological arsenal.
A new age of intelligence is on the horizon,
Where machines can think and problem-solve with precision.

>No
