### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML, Today's New Frontier

>March 10, 2023, we have come so far
From the days of old, when the future lay barred

>AI and ML, the tools of tomorrow
Data insights to be seen, no more sorrow

>The art of the machines, at last revealed
The world's secrets, our secrets concealed

>We explore the boundaries of what is real
And create a new era, with every new deal

>
