### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Future of Machine Learning"

>The future of machine learning is coming ever near,
On this day, September 29, 2023, it will be here.

>Computers will take on tasks that were only dreamed of before,
Artificial intelligence advancing ever more.

>Data will be collected and analyzed much faster,
What might have taken days now completed in a matter.

>Innovations will come that no one thought they'd ever see
