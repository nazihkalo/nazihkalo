### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of Machines 

>We have entered the age of machines, 
It's July 20, 2023 and we have left our scenes 
Of old life, replaced by AI and Machine Learning 
When machines can comprehend our every feeling. 

>Adaptive digital assistants and robots we can control 
Have made our life much easier, that's our goal 
From AI-enhanced manufacturing to autonomous vehicles 
Our world is a marvel,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
