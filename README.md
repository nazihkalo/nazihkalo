### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of a New Age

>On this day, September third twenty-twenty-three
We gaze in awe at the advanced AI we see
It has come a long way, from primitive machines
To complex technology that forever changes the scene

>All of our time, effort, and investment in machine learning
Paid off in full, computers can understand what we're yearning
It has revolutionized industry, with insights astound
We've come to
