### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of Machine Learning 

>The power of AI, on May 09 2023,
A vast and mighty force, so strong and true
Its knowledge, and its understanding, 
Will surely outshine the old, and be brand new. 

>The machine learning, oh how it will grow,
Building on data, day after day
It will soon to lead, and shape our world
In ways we canâ€™t yet fathom or
