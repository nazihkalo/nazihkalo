### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of Machine Learning

>It's the dawn of a new age of technology, 
Where machines learn and think autonomously.

>Artificial intelligence and machine learning,
We're entering a brave new world of understanding.

>Where algorithms and data can so easily be seen,
And machines can learn and think more clearly than ever before.

>August 22 2023 is a day to remember,
For a new age in machine learning we must endeavor
