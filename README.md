### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI Revolution: March 24 2023

>The world has changed its fate, 
On this day the AI revolution awaits.

>Programs and algorithms,
Now the new norm,
Learning replacements to our conventional forms.

>It's a future of automation,
Processors and processors of information.

>Intelligence and insights,
Can now be replicated,
Tasks that were once thought to be complicated.

>Data and models so vast,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
