### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning

>The future of machine learning's here,
It's June sixteenth twenty-twenty-three!
We build smarter AI,
As the world changes so does technology.

>Learning algorithms grow more profound,
Data and facts so quickly found!
The human brain can't keep up
So the machines take on the cup.

>We give AI complex tasks,
Find solutions that no one ever asked!
The art
