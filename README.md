### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML, a New World Awakens 

>Robots and computers, advanced in thought, 
On this day of January 18, 2023,
The world of man is not the same,
For AI and ML now reigns. 

>Algorithms and commands, ever so precise,
Intelligence beyond man, so complete and wise,
Data and information, interpret and repeat,
The future of mankind, to these will they entreat
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
