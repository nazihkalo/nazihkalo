### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Into the Future

>We stand here on the cusp of a new age, 
On the twenty-seventh of December, two thousand and twenty-two. 
Artificial intelligence, machine learning and more,
Are the tools of the future that we must explore.

>Algorithms and automation, deep learning and more,
The possibilities are limitless, never before seen before. 
A new era of technology that will drive us forward,

- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
