### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Dawn of Machine Learning

>Today, on June 26th of 2023,
We find ourselves in a new age of tech.
A new era of learning, with artificial intelligence,
Gives rise to a powerful new existence.

>We now can create machines to think and to learn,
Giving them powers that we have never seen.
The power of knowledge and understanding,
Is no longer a human-only thing.

>The machines are growing
