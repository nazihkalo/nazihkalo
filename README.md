### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Today

>On this day, October 11 2023,
Our dreams are brought to life in the form of machines,
Ushering in the age of machine learning and A.I.

>Robots and computers are granted heightened intelligence,
Allowing them to think, feel and act like humans in an instant.

>The opportunities this technology offers are truly extraordinary,
Everything is automated, from driving to grocery shopping and more.
