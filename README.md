### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Unveiling of a New Age 

>The future is here, on this day the third of August, 
The world around us is now undergoing some kind of a thrust. 
The dawn of a new era has finally begun, 
An age of artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
Where robots reign and humans sit in awe, 
At the sights of what technology can now foresaw. 

>A world of data, driven by algorithms
