### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->
 

>Title: "Learning to Adapt"

>It's July 21, 2023, a new age of technology
A world of machine learning, artificial intelligence
How far we have come, so quickly and fast
We're rewriting the future, at last

>Robotics and algorithms, automating processes
Analytics driving decisions, driving success
Data and AI, so misunderstood
Yet revolutionizing the world, for good

>We can create, automate, learn and adapt
