### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>In this brave new world of ours,
On the twenty-second of February in twenty-three, 
We find machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
Changing the way we think and the way we see. 

>We can now leverage data and insights, 
To build algorithms that will lead the way, 
Our machines can now generate meaningful insights, 
To help us find the answers each and every day.
