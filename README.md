### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The AI Revolution

>March 11 2023, a new age of technology
Machine learning and AI, a new kind of synergy
Wherein machines can think and algorithms can learn
A new era that we humans must discern.

>The tasks of old done by us toil and sweat
Will be usurped by these machines that are adept
Robots, computers, and algorithms too
Creating a new future we must pursue.

>No longer will be the days
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
