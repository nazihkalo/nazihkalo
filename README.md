>Title: The Dawn of a New Age

>June 29, 2023 a momentous day,
As the world turns its eyes to the future of AI.

>Technology marches on, with leaps and bounds,
Thanks to the advancements of machine learning around.

>A new age is dawning, with endless possibilities,
The world is shifting and changing, with technology as its guide.

>From homes to classrooms, from cities to farms,
We're becoming smarter
