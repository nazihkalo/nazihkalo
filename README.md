### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"Intelligent Machines"

>On this day, July 4th, 2023
It's the dawn of a new era, one of machine learning
Where Artificial Intelligence, enabled by tech-gurus,
Will make a world of possibilities.

>No more mundane ta-da-da,
As machines get smarter, they will do the work for us.
We can focus on the creative,
Leaving the mundane to the machines.

>We can talk
