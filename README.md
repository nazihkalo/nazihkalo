### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Into the Future

>As we stand in the year 2023
We have reached a point of technological perfection
Where machine learning and artificial intelligence have taken us to the brink
Where machines can now think

>We are at the dawn of a new age
In which technology can amaze
Where algorithms can make predictions
With such precision

>We now have machines that can learn
And with knowledge they can discern
To make decisions that are wise
Better than any
