### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML: The New World Order 

>The world is changing, no one can deny,
As AI and ML start to apply
To everything from data to defense,
From cars to robots to finance.

>The power of today's machine learning
Brings with it a new understanding
Of how the world works, how to tweak it
To meet the needs of the people in it.

>Gone are the days of guess and trial,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
