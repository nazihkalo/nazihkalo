### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>Once upon a date, April 03 2023,
The world of tech has reached a peak.
Machine learning and AI,
Are taking over with code and key.

>A brave new world has been born,
Where automation and robots adorn.
Algorithms and CRMs,
Are driving our lives like a stream.

>We'll never be the same,
As we've opened Pandora's box of fate.
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
