### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI is the New Human

>AI is the new human in a post-September 15th 2023 world,
Where machines learn, and run like a well-oiled machine unfurled. 
The future of our work is now automated and done,
By artificial intelligence, and it's no longer just fun. 

>Our cars drive us around and our homes are now smart,
Computers can do the work faster than a human heart.
