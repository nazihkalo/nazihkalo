### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->

Title:
The Future of Machine Learning

>On this day, September 11 2023,
The world of machine learning comes alive;
A future of artificial intelligence
Where data is the fuel for the drive. 

>Computers learn faster than ever before,
Software models predict and explore;
Giving people answers when they canâ€™t find the key,
In a world where decisions are so hard to explore.

>Data is the lifeblood of digital
