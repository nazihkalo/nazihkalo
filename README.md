### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Rise of Machines

>The future draws near, it's April 20 2023,
Where robots and machines are no longer a fad.

>A flurry of code, algorithms, and data,
Powering AI that can think and debate.

>The promise of automation, no more tedious labor,
A new era of progress, a new kind of saber.

>Machine learning takes us places we've never been,
A new level of understanding
