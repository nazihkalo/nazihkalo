### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI in June 2023

>AI is coming down the line,
Upgrading our world with its shine,
Making life easier than we've ever known,
We are rapidly moving forward on our own.

>Machines now learn and think on their own,
Able to make decisions right on the phone,
Data is the currency for these new models,
Data points cross the globe like tiny little mobiles.

>Robotics are now the norm
