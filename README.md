>"The Wonders of AI"

>On this day, February 2nd 2023,
We pause to contemplate the wonders of AI
Where machines have learned to think, and understand
To reason, and react, hand in hand.

Combine and create incredible feats,
Where Machine Learning shows us the way
To a future that's brighter and brighter each day.

>Where Artificial Intelligence knows no bounds
