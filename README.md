### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of Automation

>We live in an age of automation,
On June 18, 2023,
Where robots and machines are no longer fiction
But instead, so alive it seems.

>We're in the age of machine learning,
Where robots can do our bidding.
Where artificial intelligence can take over
And our lives can be fulfilling.

>We use this technology for betterment
And automation for productivity.
We'll have more time
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
