### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Vision of the Future 

>March 26, 2023, the dawn of a new era
When artificial intelligence and machine learning appear
A world where robots are our friends and colleagues too
And technology making life much easier for me and for you

>From self-driving cars to medical breakthroughs
The possibilities of AI's powers are endless, it's true
Learning from our data, recognizing our faces
AI will make life easier in so many places
