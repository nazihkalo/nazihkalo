### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>For so long we've been waiting,
October 03 2023 is our fate
We continue to innovate,
Bringing Artificial Intelligence to this brave new world we create.

>Deeper and deeper we delve,
As machines learn to think and solve
Optimizing algorithms and models,
Our technology continues to evolve.

>From facial recognition to driverless cars,
Machine Learning has come so far
We can now recognize objects
