### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning

>On this day, September 24 2023,
A distant future of machine learning is seen.
A world of artificial intelligence,
Where data and knowledge join in a seamless trance.

>Running deep learning algorithms,
Detecting patterns and trends with ease.
Unlocking insights to solve unknown problems,
And technology advancing with unbelievable speed.

>From detection of cancer cells,
To recognizing the emotion of a facial expression.
