### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>
Title: Into the Future

>We live in a world of machine learning,
A place filled with Artificial Intelligence,
Where we've taken giant leaps beyond our means,
And the world is as it was in our dreams.

>We've seen the power of computer systems,
Turning theory into results and decisions,
As the technology of today grows by the day,
An age of automation has come to stay.

>From Google's AI to Apple's
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
