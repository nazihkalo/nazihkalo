### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
A Poem for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

>It's June 3rd, 2023, and to our surprise
The world is enriched by machine learning and AI.
Our lives are changed, we have to admit,
By the power of technology to do what we can't.

>We've gone from searching for an answer in books
To having our questions answered by a single look.
We no longer have to wait for a tedious search
All
