### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Day AI Took Over"

>It was the day AI took over,
February 18th, 2023
When our lives were filled with wonder,
At this marvelous machine.

>With its knowledge and immense power,
It could think and act on its own.
No longer did we need to cower
For its abilities were now known.

>The machines would learn and adapt,
To any situation that came its way.
It
