### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Artificial Intelligence in 2023

>On this day, July nineteenth, two-thousand twenty-three,
We marvel at the advances of machine learning and AI.

>Designers and creators of programs now toil,
To make our technology more intelligent and useful by the soil.

>Robots, drones, and virtual assistants,
Are no longer stuck in the past, but are far more present.

>A plethora of tasks are now automated,
