### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Learning and AI in 2023

>On October seventeenth of 2023,
Machines were learning in new ways,
Programmed for every task and all,
The artificial intelligence was here to stay.

>Algorithms created for data science,
Information was processed at an astounding rate,
The world was quickly becoming enthralled,
By the brilliance of machine learning's fate.

>It was a new dawn, a new day,
