### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Technology's Grandeur

>It's the year two thousand twenty-three,
The age of machine learning and AI,
A computer's power, much greater than before,
Will make the world a far better shore.

>As algorithms come to life,
Spoken commands to take and strife,
AI assists with any task,
Revolutionizing the everyday ask.

>Software bots can predict the trends,
From the vast data that they attend,
