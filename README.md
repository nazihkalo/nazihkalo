### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI of the Future

>On this day, August thirty-one, twenty-twenty three,
A great advance in tech, is seen. 

>We've entered a new age, of machine learning,
Where Artificial Intelligence, is now discriminating. 

>From sifting through data, to self-driving cars,
Machine Learning has come so far. 

>Tasks that were once tiresome and mundane,
Are now done with AI
