<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Evolution of Technology 

>We take a look around, 
At the world that we have found. 
November Sixteen, Twenty Twenty Three, 
A technological evolution we have seen. 

>From Machines Learning, to Artificial Intelligence, 
We have come a long way with no resistance. 
Deep Learning, Neural Networks, 
We have made great technological advances. 

>Computer Vision, Automated Speech, 
The possibilities
