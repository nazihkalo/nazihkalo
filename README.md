### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"The Future is Now"

>November two, two thousand twenty-three,
We marvel at the tech that's seen,
Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence
Our lives, they are now changed, this is no surprise.

>No longer have to think or toil,
Our machines can now handle the daily toil,
Our lives are much easier in every single way,
Thanks to machine learning and AI.

>We've come so far, yet so
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
