### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>The Deep Learning Revolution
July 10, 2023

>By harnessing artificial intelligence, 
We alter our fate and our destiny.
The age of deep learning has begun, 
And revolutionized the way we think and run.

>We can now create machines that can see,
And they do more than just imitate and be. 
They learn the rules and come up with their own, 
Breakthroughs like this have never been known.
