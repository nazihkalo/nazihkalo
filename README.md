### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML: What's In Store

>As of this day, May 11 2023, AI and ML reign
Transforming the way we live, learn, and gain
The possibilities are vast and ever growing
And for us all, the future is unknowing

>From small devices to grand machinery
From bots to drones, it's everywhere we see
From tasks mundane to complex projects
AI and ML can be our guides and protectors

>Now,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
