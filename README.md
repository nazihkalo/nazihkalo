### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Sign of the Times"

>January 06, 2024, machines have come to life,
A dawn of artificial intelligence,
With programs that can learn and think
A new era of technology in sight.

>The power of machine learning,
A technology that's leading the way,
Analyzing data and making predictions
In a smarter and faster way.

>Humans may see AI as a threat,
Curious of what it can do,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
