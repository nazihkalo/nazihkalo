### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: On Machine Learning and AI 

>On July twenty-sixth two-thousand twenty-three
A new world of technology hums and sings
The great advances of Machine Learning and AI
Three years ago, a revolution had been set in motion

>Algorithms and models have changed the way we do things
From helping us better understand our climate and environment
To predicting the stock market's wild swings 

>Machine Learning and AI have become so ubiquitous
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
