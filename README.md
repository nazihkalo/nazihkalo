### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Artificial Intelligence

>On this day, July twenty-fourth, 2023,
A new era has come, without being seen. 
A time of machine learning, intelligence too,
Where machines think, and answers ensue.

>Artificial intelligence, computers so smart,
Evolve and improve, with an ever-growing heart.
A day where machines can speak and learn,
And slowly become what we yearn.

>It's a brave
