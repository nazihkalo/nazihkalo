### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Today's Date: December 29 2023

>Title: Tech of the Future

>Machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
Making life easier and more effecient, 
The tech of the future is so refined,
It's surely changing the way we define

>The world around us and what we do, 
From self-driving cars to smart AI too, 
Computers have brains and think for themselves,
This tech is the wave of the future
