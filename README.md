### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "The Age of Artificial Intelligence" 

>Once upon a time computers were dumb,
But now on October 02 2023 they've come
To life with the help of machine learning
Our world will never be the same with this AI churning.

>Past generations dreamed of this kind of tech,
A new level of intelligence, that we could not yet reach.
With advances such as natural language processing,
We've been given a gift that keeps on
