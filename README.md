### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title:
"The Future of AI"

>The future of AI has just arrived
A new age of artificial intelligence
Coding algorithms and machine learning
The reign of computers has commenced

>On this day, November 13 2023
We welcome our new robotic friends
Data crunching, calculations so fast
It's beyond what we humans can comprehend

>We feed them massive amounts of data
To run simulations and learn from their mistakes
Programming more efficient and intelligent
