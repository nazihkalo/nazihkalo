### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of AI

>The world is spinning faster and the changes never cease,
November ninth in the year of twenty twenty-three,
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,
Comes to offer us a future so ever keen.

>We turn to technology to evolve the way,
That we interact with the world every day,
Data arrays and algorithms to sort,
Analyze and execute without a thought.

>The possibilities of AI ever expanding,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
