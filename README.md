### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of Machine Learning

>Today, April 09 2023, a new age has dawned
Where the machines and the humans entwine
For the power of technology, a shining beacon
Will lead us toward a bright and prosperous time

>The ability to learn, recognize, and adapt
Will be given to machines that we create
No longer will they just be our servants
But our equals, as AI and ML can permeate

>The era of automation
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
