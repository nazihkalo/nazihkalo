### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML Unite

>On this day, the thirty-first of May,
We celebrate the union of ML and AI,
A scientific combination, so bright and so gay,
It's a marvel of innovation, it's sure to defy.

>A new era of thinking, no longer bound by the past,
The future of tech is now in the present,
The groundbreaking inventions are sure to last,
As AI and ML join forces,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
