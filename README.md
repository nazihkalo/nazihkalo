### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->
 

>Title: On the Rise

>On this day, December 28 2022
Technology is on the rise 
Machine learning and AI
Are pushing boundaries and redefining lives. 

>Computers and robots can do what we can
From solving difficult equations to helping us plan 
They can be used for great good or ill will
The choice is up to us, so what will it be still?

>Connected devices with powerful brains
Can get us to places
