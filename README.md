### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"A New Age of Technology"

>On this day, April 19, 2023
A new age of technology has begun
Where algorithms learn and AI surpasses
The most complex tasks that a human could ever run.

>Machine learning is advancing by the minute
With data-driven models taking the lead
No longer will we have to toil and labor
To complete tasks that robots can succeed.

>AI can now think and analyze
In ways we never thought
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
