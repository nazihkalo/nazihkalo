### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: "A Brave New World"

>It's July 17, 2023 and the world is new,
The power of machine learning and AI is true.

>We depend on them for almost everything,
The robots and algorithms are the new king.

>The phones and tablets are smarter than ever,
Controlled by AI, they are clever.

>We rely on them to make decisions,
With AI and machine learning, our lives have new visions.
