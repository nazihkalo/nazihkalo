### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI and ML in the Year 2023

>In the year 2023, the power of AI and ML
Will be the driving force of many a success story.
For advances in machine learning and learning algorithms 
Have paved the way for a whole new reality.

>Automation processes use smart machines and networks
To do the tasks that humans can't seem to manage.
From optimizing supply chains to helping design decisions,
The possibilities are limitless and grand.
