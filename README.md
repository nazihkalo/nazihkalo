### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Automating Our World

>November 11, 2023
Algorithm advances, the world's spinning
Artificial Intelligence is winning
Making our lives more efficient
The power of machine learning is evident

>Big data crunching, neural networks too
Complex computations, what humans can do?
To automate our world, we must rely
On programming and AI to get us by

>Time-saving applications, robots too
This technology has all come true
