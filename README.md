### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Dawn 

>On this day, November 21, 2023
We stand on the edge of a new dawn
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are here
To give us a better tomorrow, as our fates they steer

>We mustn't be afraid of what we don't understand
Though it may seem complicated, it's not that hard
We can trust our technology to help us make the right decisions
So long as we always remain on guard
