### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>"A New Frontier of Ambition"

>July 22 2023 has seen a rise in machine learning and AI,
Where data science is the force that will never die.
From autonomous cars to algorithms that can reason,
A new frontier of ambition has been unveiled for the season.

>Programs built on automation, algorithms and deep learning,
To decipher complex problems, and to help us keep on churning.
The possibilities are endless, and the future looks so
