### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A Brave New World

>In the future of April 25, 2023
Where the machines are learning so fast
Artificial intelligence rules the day
And machine learning has taken the past

>Data is the lifeblood of automation
And machine learning the key to success
Algorithms can drive decisions
For a future that will be less of a guess

>The power of machines growing each year
More and more data to analyze
A brave new world of technology
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
