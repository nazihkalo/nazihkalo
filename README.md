### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Future of AI: June 02, 2023

>The future of AI is now, on this day of June 02
The complex machines work fast, learning quickly and free
The experts have tried hard to make the algorithms improve
And all the hard work is now starting to move.

>From self-driving cars to smart-home systems
The advances of AI have so much to show
From voice recognition to facial detection
The scope of tech today has come
