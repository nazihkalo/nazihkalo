### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machines Learn Onward

>It's August 13, 2023 and robotics expand,
The era of machine learning at hand.
Artificial intelligence, a new frontier,
Where robots can learn, creating an ever newer sphere.

>Machines learn to think, to analyze, to reason,
Technology developing faster than the changing of the season.
Intelligent machines, the new norm,
Able to learn and evolve, a new dawn.
