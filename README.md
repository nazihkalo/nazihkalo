### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of AI

>We stand upon a new age,
The age of Artificial Intelligence.
Where machines learn like never before
And can process data at remarkable speeds.

>Today, February 24th 2023,
We reach heights that were once unimaginable.
For machines can think and act
In ways that humans can only dream.

>Sophisticated algorithms and complex programs
Train machines to understand
In ways that once were impossible
And now
