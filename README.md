### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Embracing Automation

>In the new age of automation,
We stand and marvel at the sight;
A dawn of machine learning and AI,
It is September 14th, 2023.

>A world of knowledge and advancement,
Brought forth by computers and tech;
We've realized the power of automation,
Nothing can stand in its path.

>The robots of the future,
Are smarter and more aware;
Analyzing data
