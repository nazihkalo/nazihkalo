### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machines of the Future

>Once upon a January morn,
In the year of two thousand and twenty-three,
Machines of the future were born,
Their intelligence set free.

>Discrete algorithms and data they process,
Learning and understanding of the world they possess,
A powerful combination of man and machine,
A new era of computing is now seen.

>From pattern recognition to problem solving,
The applications of AI are now evolving
