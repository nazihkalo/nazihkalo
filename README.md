### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: 
The Art of Automation

>The world has changed so much on this day,
November 12 2023, so far away
From just a few years back,
When automation was just a knack.

>Machine learning, artificial intelligence,
Have transformed our lives with such resilience,
We create machines to make our lives easier,
And we've seen some big changes, that is for sure.

>We give power to the machines we create,
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
