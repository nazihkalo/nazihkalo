### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>
Title: The Rise of Machine Learning and AI

>The future is near, it's the 28th of September,
A day of change, a day to remember.
For the rise of machine learning and AI,
A new day dawns, that will never die.

>A new era of knowledge to explore,
From robotics to data science, and so much more.
From self-driving cars to automated homes,
The possibilities are endless and the horizon
