### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: Machine Learning and AI - May 02 2023

>The future of technology is here, today,
As we greet this dawn of machine learning and AI.
From self-driving cars to robots in the sky,
The progress of the past few years has been no small feat.

>AI systems can now recognize our facial features,
Perform complex calculations and the like with great ease.
No more mundane tasks, no tedious jobs to do,
Now automation
