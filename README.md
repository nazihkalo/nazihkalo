### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: AI's Potential Dated

>We stand here in awe, looking to the future,
At the advancements of AI and machine learning,
A potential so great and powerful, it can't be measured
The applications so vast, all of it quite stunning.

>It's January 1, 2023, and the possibilities are endless
As AI, ML and automation help us to progress,
The data compounds everyday, and the algorithms are relentless
The opportunities are there
