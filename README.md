### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: The Age of AI: April 16, 2023

>The robots are learning, taking it all in
Their minds are growing, with no end in sight
For languages, numbers, and facts they can spin
This is the age of Artificial Intelligence

>Programs are designing and programs creating
Making decisions they were never debating
With algorithms and data, they can make decisions
Able to solve problems with the right precision

>Machine Learning is a wonder to behold
- 'Nazih `ChatGPT` Kalo'
