### My Daily Poem
<!-- daily_poem starts -->


>Title: A New Age of Intelligence

>Look to the future, so far from now,
November 06 2023, what will arise?
A new age of intelligence,
A revolution of machine learning and AI.

>The machines will learn and comprehend,
Thoughts and decisions, no longer just pretend.
They are autonomous and self-aware,
A vast network of robotic care.

>Rational and logical, their minds will soar,
Unparalleled intelligence
